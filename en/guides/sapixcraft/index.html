                     <p>On the <a href="https://discord.gg/UT3nXdm" />Sapixcord</a> there are a few questions beeing
                        asked on a daily basis:</p>
                     </br>
                     <ul>
                        <li>How do I download the (texture) resource pack?</li>
                        <li>Whenever I try to download I get on a page where...</li>
                        <li>How does that (name here) installer work and what has it to do with Sapixcraft?</li>
                     </ul>
                     </br>
                     <p>That lead me to writing this guide.</p>

                     <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Why does anyone use AdFocus, AdFly & co. ?</strong></br>
                           Creating and offering resource packages costs money. Starting with the fees for the programs
                           up to the costs for the webhosting.
                           The creators don't want to sit on these costs, and among us, of course, gain a small profit.
                           Websites such as AdFocus and the like pay for the user to stay on the site for a certain time
                           and display advertisements.
                           Since the providers cannot check each advertisement individually, it can also happen that
                           insecure or intrusive advertising is displayed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Are AdFocus and co. insecure?</strong></br>
                           Of course not! You just have to follow my instructions carefully and not download everything
                           you are prompted to.
                        </li>

                     <h2>1. Choose your download</h2>
                     <p>Go to the <a href="https://sapixcraft.com" />official website</a> and head over to the downloads
                        section, select your branch, version and resolution. You will be redirected to AdFocus.</p>
                     <blockquote>
                        <h4>Dont click on "Download" buttons inside adverts</h4>
                        <p>Below you can see a typical advert that has a large "Download" button. Users may think that
                           this is the download they want but it is not.
                           There are (for me) three ways to recognize an ad-download-button:
                           <ul>
                              <li><strong>They don't match Design</strong></br>
                                 As you can see the advertisement doesn't quite match the design of the webpage (mine is
                                 dark and luaxblue)</li>
                              <li><strong>They have nothing to do with the topic</strong></br>
                                 If you can read you're at a clear advantage! Read the text next to the download button,
                                 it is about Grammarly (a software to improve grammer, maybe I should give it a try).
                                 Therefore this is likely not to be your download.</li>
                              <li><strong>They may be declared or have symbols on them</strong></br>
                                 On some pages you can see a line stating "Advertisement" above or near to adverts. In
                                 case of Sapixcraft,
                                 you can see a blue cross and triangle in the top-right corner, this is an indicator for
                                 Google ads.
                              </li>
                           </ul>
                           </br>
                        </p>

                     <h2>2. Wait</h2>
                     <p>On AdFocus you have to wait for a moment as you can read in the top-right corner where it says
                        "Please wait x seconds".
                        I've painted the screenshot below green and red. The green area is safe and you may click on
                        buttons there whereas
                        the red area is unsafe and you should keep you fingers away from it.</br>
                        After the countdown expired, press the skip button. This redirects you back to the sapixcraft
                        official site.
                        If a new tab opens with anything other, just close that tab and press skip again.

                     <p>In addition you may receive pop-ups saying that read like "x wants to send you notifications". I
                        recommend you to always deny them.</br>
